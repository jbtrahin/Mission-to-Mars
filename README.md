# Mission-to-Mars
Build an app to scrape websites for data pertaining to the Mission to Mars, and then create an HTML page to display your findings.

## Module Overview
In this module, you’ll automate a web browser to visit different websites to extract data about the Mission to Mars. You’ll store it in a NoSQL database, and then render the data in a web application created with Flask.

## Project Overview
In this challenge, you will scrape additional content for the web app. This time, the focus is to add more images to the app.

The goals for this challenge are to:
1. Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a web browser and scrape high-resolution images.
2. Use a MongoDB database to store data from the web scrape.
3. Update the web application and Flask to display the data from the web scrape.
4. Use Bootstrap to style the web app.
